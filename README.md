# Password Strength Checker 🔐
A simple Python-commandline program that checks the strength of a password based on several keys rule. 

## 🧠 What it Does 
When you enter a password, the program evaluates it by checking:
- Minimum length (at least 8 characters)
- Presence of:
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character (e.g. `!@#$%^&*`)
- Whether it's a common or easily guessed password

If your password passes all checks, it is marked as **strong**. Otherwise, the program tells you what to improve.
